        <p>This project is revolved around solving the problem of our client. Our client is an artist with
            Fibromyalgia, Lymphedema in her arms, and Ankylosis Spondylitis. This makes it harder for her to comfortably
            paint for long periods as it is hard for her to bear her own weight. Our mechanism is a unique solution to this
            problem.This project involves creating a solution in autodesk inventor. 
        </p>

        <p>The final prototype is a table-like device that helps the client rest her
            arm on a device and move around easily. The design consists of a tabletop
            with a u-shaped cut-out so the client can easily fit their body in the curve,
            with four table legs that are adjustable in height. The adjustable table legs can
            vertically move as the client can take out the knobs on the side and manually
            adjust the height of the table based on their preference. The knobs on the side
            of the table legs are engineered to safely secure the legs in place and designed
            to have a larger diameter at the top of the client can easily hold the knob.
            Furthermore, an aluminum track is stabilized on the table-top to allow for horizontal movement across the table
            for the arm holder. The arm holder has a u-shaped armrest that lifts and down with the aid of a linear actuator
            that can help the client angle her hand upwards. The armrest is created with rubber silicon to ensure safety for
            the client and can be easily cleaned. This prototype benefits our client by being a table that can be lean on
            which helps to reduce the weight of her body on her legs or shoulders. Also, the prototype is very helpful for
            being a painter's table that can hold our clientâ€™s painting tools.</p>
